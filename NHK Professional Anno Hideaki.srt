1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,176
I am pilot of Evangelion Unit 01, Shinji Ikari!

2
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:20,048
As soon as we started our coverage, we felt something.

3
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:28,880
That we shouldn't have taken up meeting this man.

4
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:33,152
Why Ube?

5
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:34,176
It's a secret.

6
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:35,088
What's the reason?

7
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,176
It's a secret.

8
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,160
What does Anno really want to do?

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Nothing in particular.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
Nothing comes to mind. I have no idea.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,584
Films I find interesting don't become hits.

12
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:50,672
Blockbuster movies are not my taste.

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,304
That's not for me.

14
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:56,480
Hideaki Anno, 60.

15
00:00:57,488 --> 00:01:00,256
He gave birth to the one and only movie.

16
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:10,857
The movie that changed Japanese film history and became a huge hit: Shin Godzilla.

17
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:13,760
A.T. field, full power!

18
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:24,674
Also, the anime that caused a world phenomena and changed anime history: Evangelion.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,064
Even now, 26 years after the TV broadcast, its cult remains strong.

20
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,696
When I'm watching Eva, tears come out.

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,496
I've been watching it from before my kids were born.

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,272
I love it, so I can't wait for the new one to come out.

23
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:51,632
However, the truth about it was covered by a mysterious veil.

24
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,368
I thought an alien had come. An alien.

25
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,056
Kinda like a terrorist.

26
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,808
He doesn't just want to make something interesting.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,400
How should one lead his life in these times

28
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,160
He's a unique person.

29
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:11,472
What kind of person is Hideaki Anno?

30
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:20,336
We heard that the legendary anime Evangelion would come to an end, and we asked for a coverage.

31
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:27,232
However, that was the start of many days of self torment.

32
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:31,856
You don't need to film this.

33
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:34,752
No need to film this.

34
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:36,832
Use only the good parts.

35
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:38,336
We're not so kind.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,112
 If that's so, then this project is over.

37
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:49,264
The coverage went on and on to become the longest in our TV series: 4 years.

38
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,560
Something unprecedented.

39
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:59,984
I chose to ignore the fact that my physical and mental health would be destroyed if I overdo it.

40
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:03,152
My top priority is to make something interesting.

41
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,104
Of course, we're also filming you when you're perplexed.

42
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,136
It's still not enough.
Of course, we're also filming you when you're perplexed.

43
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,176
It's still not enough.

44
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,440
It's not enough?

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,336
Is it not interesting if it's the same as up until now?

46
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:23,712
What we filmed, was a man who doesn't hesitate to do what it takes to entertain the fans.

47
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,368
Probably

48
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:39,920
The one who is most emotional during these 25 years is Shinji.

49
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,280
The Hideaki Anno that nobody knew

50
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,544
will be revealed tonight.

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,448
The filming began 4 years ago.

52
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,952
2017, in September.

53
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:18,624
Please wait.

54
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:26,384
For the first time ever, a camera enters to film scenes of the making of Evangelion in close coverage.

55
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:38,048
Production was steadily progressing inside the studio Anno had set up together with creators anyone would be jealous of.

56
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:51,232
However, director Anno was not present.

57
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:58,448
Around what time is Anno coming here?

58
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,960
It's not really fixed.

59
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,528
I spot him here only from time to time.

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,784
I don't think he comes around so often.

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,128
I wish you good luck.

62
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:19,088
Anno appears unexpectedly like a phantom.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,248
Nobody knows when he'd show up.

64
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,224
2 hours later

65
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,568
Good morning. It's nice to meet you.

66
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,184
He had silently appeared.

67
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,112
There's no need to film from here.

68
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:53,648
An enigmatic smile.

69
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,384
As the meeting begins

70
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:09,696
I'm hoping someone will offer an opinion.

71
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:14,992
If it's cool, maybe we could say it.

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,952
It's not clear if he's listening or not.

73
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,776
Wonder if it uses something like that.

74
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:23,520
I see.

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,616
Maybe inside there's a...

76
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:35,104
He doesn't show up the next day or the day after.

77
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:44,224
Apparently, there is another workplace where even his close colleagues haven't set foot in.

78
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,280
Always absent?

79
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,432
That's right.

80
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:54,192
It can't be helped.

81
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,976
Even if he turns up sometimes

82
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,088
Probably gonna sleep all day.

83
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,048
You don't get enough sleep?

84
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:26,752
There was something we had to check with Anno.

85
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,688
Is it decided that Evangelion is going to end this time?

86
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:33,968
Yes, it is.

87
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,472
The story will end.

88
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,360
Are you not fond?

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,872
Nope.

90
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,552
Will you come tomorrow?

91
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:48,976
No, I won't.

92
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,744
See you.

93
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,512
Anno was a man shrouded in mystery.

94
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,088
But his way of life was already a legend.

95
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:22,832
26 years ago, Anno was the director of the anime that caused a social phenomenon: Neon Genesis Evangelion.

96
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:27,376
I mustn't run away.

97
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:32,112
I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away.

98
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:36,592
A story about the 14-year old Shinji Ikari

99
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,832
who mounts a multipurpose humanoid decisive weapon called Evangelion

100
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,128
and gets involved in a battle with mysterious creatures known as Angels.

101
00:08:55,008 --> 00:09:00,832
The unvarnished psychological characterization moved the hearts of the audience.

102
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,576
No! I don't wanna listen!

103
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,048
Someone, please be nice to me.

104
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,512
I fought so much until now. I'm fighting with all I've got.

105
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:14,736
Won't you cherish me? Won't you be nice to me?

106
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,368
What's distinct about Anno, is that he's a frank person.

107
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:23,072
A man of perennial youth.

108
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:26,672
Although he's already 60, he doesn't grow up.

109
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:31,168
He probably wanted to become an adult but he failed at growing up.

110
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,432
If you'd look at Shinji, he's the same.

111
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:37,632
He is like that, and his anime character is the the same.

112
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:43,296
I believe that it's because that suffering is shown in the film, that young people can relate to it.

113
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,496
The pain of living.

114
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:53,760
3 theatrical installments of the movies have been released up until now.

115
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,312
They became big hits drawing over 8 million people to cinemas.

116
00:10:02,128 --> 00:10:08,000
But will the long awaited final movie actually be the end the story?

117
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,376
Newer depths drew near.

118
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:26,816
We came to understand standing as the filming went on.

119
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:38,960
With his new film, Anno is trying to substantially change the way anime is made.

120
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,064
I want to make the draft as small as I can.

121
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,848
Also, I don't want to create the draft layout in my mind.

122
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:56,560
Typically, an anime is made by first making a storyboard draft based on a script.

123
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:00,800
And the characters and backgrounds are done in accordance with it.

124
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:07,120
I can't run away, can't run away, can't run away.

125
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:13,408
However, Anno said he'd make the new film without a storyboard.

126
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:16,768
First, everyone wants to decide what they'll do.

127
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,976
They want peace of mind.

128
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,144
It's reassuring.

129
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,536
But actually, it's better not to have a storyboard.

130
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:28,240
How exactly does he plan to make it?

131
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:37,552
We got a clue to that a little over one month after our filming began.

132
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,704
I also brought these valuable items.

133
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:51,408
The main staff camp like canned sardines at a ryokan in Atami to devise the plot.

134
00:11:54,608 --> 00:12:00,080
Everyone was holding the script Anno had worked on for 8 years.

135
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:04,128
Should I say "make it somehow like"?

136
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:11,808
Based on that they come up with their own ideas and present them to Anno.

137
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:16,176
What if this monster's color is seen?

138
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,976
If he just keeps on heading straight...

139
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,712
I see your point.

140
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:22,480
Hello.

141
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,408
You can sit in the back.

142
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,464
Anywhere's fine.

143
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,968
Was the one I sent you last time received?

144
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,272
It's this one.

145
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,544
And in at the very end...

146
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,288
But Anno doesn't really look into the ideas given to him.

147
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:47,552
I believe this is used as a place for sharing.

148
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,848
I don't really know now.

149
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,568
Shall we stop for the time being?

150
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:51,856
Yes.

151
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,072
Okay.

152
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,624
More time is needed.

153
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:55,280
Yes

154
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,584
There are quite a lot of ideas for Unit 02.

155
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,240
Which one could we go with for the draft?

156
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,120
I don't know.

157
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,160
I see.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,248
Should we give it a try?

159
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,696
At least what we can work with.

160
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:10,304
Right now, I can't say.

161
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,256
He kept repeating he doesn't know now.

162
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:23,520
Recently, I had a dream I was going to the cinema to see the new Eva movie.

163
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,904
Even scenes I didn't know about...

164
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,960
Wasn't the plot ready?

165
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:32,032
But there were so many scenes I didn't know about.

166
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:32,064
Tell me about them.
But there were so many scenes I didn't know about.

167
00:13:32,064 --> 00:13:32,992
Tell me about them.

168
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,840
Hey, it was really amazing.

169
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:45,936
So Unit 01 and 02 were there, and a huge cloud storms, and then they appear on top of a huge octopus.

170
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:49,712
I felt like Anno really did it this time.

171
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,168
An octopus would be difficult.

172
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:02,656
N I C R O

173
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,910
This is like a time-lapse.

174
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,264
No need to film me.

175
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,664
I'll be leaving.

176
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,200
Goodbye.

177
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,304
Almost nothing was decided the first day.

178
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:21,968
On the second day

179
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,344
He didn't even show up.

180
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,872
I really don' t know.

181
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,640
Does this mean we have to change our ideas?

182
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:37,584
He doesn't even say if it's OK or a no go.

183
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,064
That's so like him.

184
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,832
Often seen in Evangelion.

185
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:45,472
I wonder if he saw it.

186
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,608
When we talk while looking at it, he tells me "Now I know it's not this".

187
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:54,336
But he doesn't say why.

188
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,824
I don't know if I should swing it more to the left or to the right.

189
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,824
So I have no idea what to do.

190
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,864
Moreover, I was thrown off when I read the script.

191
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,368
I said "don't leave me alone!"

192
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,328
and I grabbed him like this.

193
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,264
In the end I want to...

194
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,380
Hello.

195
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,040
On the 3rd day

196
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,320
He appeared as if nothing had happened.

197
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,328
Did you film the outside?

198
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,456
Not yet.

199
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:36,432
It's going to pour soon.

200
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,768
It seems it'll rain more heavily soon.

201
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:41,040
Film when it's raining the most.

202
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,680
You can use it as an insert edit.

203
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:50,848
I want to have the battles in a more compressed manner.

204
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,416
How should I do it?

205
00:15:52,768 --> 00:15:56,832
Unexpectedly, Anno showed us a reaction.

206
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:04,144
I want to do it in one cut as much as possible.

207
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,992
What I'm most worried about with one cuts is that a transition always becomes necessary.

208
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,784
And that transition becomes too long-winded.

209
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,960
Basically I want to go with just one shot.

210
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:17,872
Best if it can be seen in one shot.

211
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:24,192
Best if it's seen in one shot, and only after we've tried doing it in one shot and it doesn't work, is when we give up.

212
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:28,064
We need to make new discoveries like this.

213
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
Otherwise the audience won't be impressed.

214
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,504
It's limited to what I come up with.

215
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,880
More than 80 mm.

216
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
That's brutal.

217
00:16:53,296 --> 00:16:55,328
You have to go out and film this once.

217
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,007
Yes

218
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:58,432
When it's raining the most.

219
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,352
Anno is striving for something that goes beyond human intelligence.

220
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:24,576
He would even push his staff to the limit to obtain that.

221
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,632
I wonder what will happen if I keep pushing them like this.

222
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,752
It's not interesting at all if simply make it the way I see it.

223
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,264
My ideas aren't all that interesting.

224
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:50,720
I prefer something that can overrule them.

225
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,592
He's a mysterious man, really.

226
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,920
I wonder how many people there are that actually understand Anno.

227
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:21,216
The only thing I know is that it won't be Evangelion if it's not a work written and made by Anno.

228
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,352
What kind of person...

229
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,344
a person like an Angel.

230
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:30,656
A cute Angel.

231
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,224
A big one, with long arms but a cute face and round eyes.

232
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:42,432
But when he's activated, he can blow away a whole city.

233
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:49,340
I think he's rather girlish.

234
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:56,128
He does have a boyish heart, but I feel like there is also a girl dwelling inside.

235
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,552
He's a girlish boy.

236
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:04,016
3 months passed since we started filming.

237
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:16,430
Anno was actively searching for new ideas.

238
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,448
Allow me to introduce the actors.

239
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,478
Anna Mizuno as Shinji.

240
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:24,470
Nice to meet you.

241
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,472
 Let's begin. Test. Ready.

242
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:30,720
 Start

243
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,688
 Shinji

244
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,823
What are you sitting in the corner for?

245
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,626
Come over here! Now!

246
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:46,202
Motion capture is a technique that turns acting into data for purposes of animation.

247
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:52,608
However, what is one supposed to do when there is no storyboard draft?

248
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,632
We're looking for the angle. That's all we need.

249
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,688
It'll be an interesting shot if we can bring the camera to a right angle.

250
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:04,576
The angle is all we need.

251
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,320
You're just like her!

252
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:11,120
Anno was set on pursuing the entertaining aspect of the angle.

253
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:14,144
A forgotten item.

254
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:17,568
There are many missed calls by Suzuhara and Aida.

255
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:22,576
According to Anno, the angle is the essence of anime.

256
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:28,896
As long as the angle and editing is good, the animation can be still.

257
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:31,440
There's no need for it to move.

258
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,528
Does this pertain only to animation?

258
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:37,790
No, even for live-action.

259
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:44,288
Regardless of whether the actors can surprise you, if the angle and editing is well done, it'll be entertaining.

260
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:51,104
The main staff are the ones looking for the good angle.

261
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:58,000
Anno only watches over them.

262
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,760
Sorry, it was alcohol.

263
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:09,696
Could you try getting a good angle of the two and the 1.8 bottle?

264
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,216
It's fine if the camera shakes.

265
00:21:19,632 --> 00:21:22,064
There's not even one good wideshot from the front.

266
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,848
There's almost none of these we can use.

267
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:28,896
This is pretty difficult, eh?

268
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:39,392
The filming went on for days but Anno didn't seem satisfied.

269
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:46,848
Isn't this enough?

270
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,136
No, keep looking for it.

271
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:49,776
Okay.

272
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:57,866
There's no need to film me. Film this.

273
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,440
It's actually difficult because we're overflowing with footage.

274
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,544
That's what Anno wants.

275
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:13,515
We have footage where we can't tell if's what we're after or we just filmed by chance.

276
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,240
Isn't that what's good about it?

277
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,168
He's happy if we have a lot of footage.

278
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,840
Don't you also feel like you want to try holding the camera?

279
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,312
Nah, I'm fine.

280
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:29,904
I leave it to them. It's better to have them do it than me doing it.

281
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:33,296
If I do it from the start, I have to do everything myself.

282
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:36,032
It'll be limited to only that.

283
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:42,978
Does it feel like you're filming something different from your ideas this time around?

284
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,432
That's why I'm doing this.

285
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:49,904
If I wanted to make it true to my ideas, it'd be faster to draw a storyboard.

286
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:53,040
If one tries to create from inside their head...

287
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:59,248
It's limited to the world inside their mind.

288
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,032
There's nothing from the outside.

289
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:07,952
I want to express with things beyond my mind.

290
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,808
Perhaps it's an antithesis to my inflated ego.

291
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,456
Animation is but a mass of ego.

292
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:21,376
Why did you think like that?

293
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,272
It's a secret.

294
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,224
A secret?

295
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:26,800
Yes.

296
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,496
He never reveals the important part.

297
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,976
However, we managed to catch a glimpse of his true intentions.

297
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
Alright.

298
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:56,384
Anno started to look for the angle himself.

299
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:04,880
Anno always thinks he should let others do it at first.

300
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,408
But that doesn't end up the case.

301
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:14,336
In the end he fills the gaps himself or he rewrites it.

302
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:18,672
I guess we haven't managed to make something Anno would be satisfied with.

303
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:24,016
My abs hurt.

304
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:31,086
He shifts into being a creator the moment he thinks "this way'd be better".

305
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,832
Anno's compulsive drive is enigmatic to even his staff.

306
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:45,104
His blade was also pointed at us.

307
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:55,312
It happened half a year after we'd begun filming.

308
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,792
Please excuse me.

309
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:06,800
We were called by Anno when there was something he minded about the coverage.

310
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,536
I heard that there was some concern on your end regarding the our documentary filming.

311
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,904
I would like to propose some things we could improve on if you tell us more about it.

312
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:25,152
Well, it can't be helped there's only one camera.

313
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:30,088
Well there's also the GoPro sometimes.

313
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:36,900
But basically, I'm bothered when you point the camera at me at times when it's pointless to do so.

314
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,672
You know, I'm not the center of all this.

315
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:51,488
I may be the producer and director, but I'm the type that likes to have others do the work on set.

316
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:55,312
Their bafflement at times is amusing.

317
00:25:57,024 --> 00:26:01,856
There's no need to film me, as I know that what I'm doing is extremely specific.

318
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,944
The people around me who are having troubles should be focused on.

319
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:14,624
Actually, Tamota (the director) is filming quite a lot of that too, so naturally, we also have footage of their frustration.

320
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,568
It's not enough.

321
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,368
It's still not enough?

322
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,752
Nope.

323
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:23,392
It's not so important what I say, you could just put narration over that.

324
00:26:24,464 --> 00:26:28,224
It'd be good if you express it through their reactions.

325
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,664
It's not fun if you make the same documentary you've made until now.

326
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:42,000
I want you to make an entertaining documentary, so that my work can also look interesting.

327
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:48,544
Then, at the studio editing room

328
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,256
I don't know.

329
00:26:54,384 --> 00:27:00,080
Tsurumaki was drowning in the whirlpool of confusion due to the task Anno had given him.

330
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,552
Let's decide on the marriage tomorrow.

331
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:05,856
We have to delete this cut.

332
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:14,144
They were making a Previs.

333
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,376
It edits the motion capture images and shows a simulation of the complete state.

334
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,224
This is the indicator in filmmaking.

335
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:27,744
I love you.

336
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:30,800
I think this one looks better.

337
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:43,680
However, the initial process moved at a sluggish pace due to the number of angles.

338
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:49,568
Was this Old Lady B?

339
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
It's C.

339
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,680
I can't tell at all.

340
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,944
We've been making anime for tens of years now, so it's become a routine for all of us.

341
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,264
Including me, of course.

342
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,248
If we were to make Eva the way anime is made now, it will only be a continuation of the 3 movies we made so far.

343
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:15,280
We'd have merely made another film similar to those.

344
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:19,664
The probability of it becoming something new becomes extremely low.

345
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,184
I personally don't like that.

346
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:34,624
Anno had entrusted his main staff with the 30 minute A-part Previs of the movie.

347
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,560
But he didn't seem satisfied with how it's coming along.

348
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,072
What did you think of the Previs Todoroki and Tsurumaki made?

349
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,584
That there's a lot left to do.

350
00:28:59,184 --> 00:29:03,936
Will you be the one doing it from now here?

351
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,264
Yes, because there's no time.

352
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,840
Will you choose the best parts of each of their work?

353
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,032
I'm not really sure.

354
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,848
Maybe I'll restructure it from scratch.

355
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:27,680
2019, March 19.

356
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:32,208
Anno enters the editing room.

357
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:35,920
I'll do it from start.

358
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:37,328
From the start, okay.

359
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:42,752
He says he'll do it all over with the editor.

360
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,488
Number 37 of this and

361
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,384
37, yes.

362
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:57,360
37, 39, and 43.

363
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:04,592
From here onward, it's Anno vs. himself.

364
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,168
A battle of how much he can drive up the film by relying only on himself.

365
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,720
Boring, so boring.

366
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,992
It's too ordinary.

367
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:26,880
Is this okay?

368
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:29,088
It's okay? It isn't strange?

369
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Uh, it's fine.

370
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,992
It's alright.

371
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:37,264
You not only film, you edit too right? Will you help us out?

372
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:38,432
Oh no, no, no.

373
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,320
Tell me if you get an idea.

374
00:30:50,736 --> 00:30:53,088
Despite all of these, the angles are still not enough.

375
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:08,464
That night we were asked to join Anno for dinner for the first time.

376
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:15,392
Why did you decide to accept a documentary coverage this time?

377
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,424
Business purposes.

378
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,936
I expected that answer.

379
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,648
The film'll be left out if it remains shrouded in mystery.

380
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:29,408
I need to reveal a bit that the making process was interesting.

381
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,656
Maybe it's an age when things don't go well.

382
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:40,208
There are fewer people now that enjoy things shrouded in mystery.

383
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:41,264
I see.

384
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,392
Just one more glass.

385
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,224
Excuse me.

386
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:52,272
And cup of tea.

388
00:31:52,352 --> 00:31:52,912
Tea? Okay.

389
00:31:54,752 --> 00:31:59,184
Do you take pride in this anime for making a name for yourself?

390
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,472
No.

391
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,024
You don't?

392
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:05,056
It's not business where you boast about it.

393
00:32:06,288 --> 00:32:07,328
Is that so?

394
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,656
But haven't you changed a lot of people's life?

395
00:32:11,168 --> 00:32:12,688
I have to apologize for that.

396
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:21,024
It might have been for the better for some of these people, but it could have also been for the worse.

397
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,408
So I can't say anything.

398
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:27,408
I hope it was for the best.

399
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,656
It was after that

400
00:32:35,616 --> 00:32:38,944
Anno locked himself into the editing room.

401
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:45,904
And plunged into a boundary known to none.

402
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:57,424
He has to overcome all the difficulties with his own strength since he set the bar so high for his staff.

403
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,120
For several days, the work continued until the late night.

405
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:15,888
No good.

406
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,240
No good.

406
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,240
No good.

407
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,056
I'm losing sight of how the angle should be.

408
00:33:32,288 --> 00:33:39,936
Anno put all his physical and mental strength into it and started and fought with his back against the wall.

409
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,456
The first glimpse of him like this.

410
00:33:57,392 --> 00:34:00,400
There was a worrying scene.

411
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,600
The protagonist Shinji is brought down to roam alone.

412
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:16,400
His ideas are all predictable, regardless of what he attempts.

413
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,512
I'll go look for some photos.

414
00:34:41,232 --> 00:34:43,376
He said something bizzare.

415
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:49,488
A scene where he roams alone only inside a tunnel.

416
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:57,504
We'll try binding them together with half close-ups when he enters the tunnel.

417
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:00,384
In different tunnels?

418
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,728
Yes, different tunnels.

419
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,968
He say he'll express the emotions only with tunnels.

420
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,496
He enter from here.

421
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:16,800
I suddenly thought that the inside of a tunnel is fine.

422
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:24,912
Let's see how it turned out.

423
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:37,488
I feel like we went further than I thought we could.

424
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,280
It's only a tunnel, though.

425
00:35:39,712 --> 00:35:42,528
We'll structure it with this.

426
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,816
Let's take a break.

427
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,616
If we do it the usual way, only normal plain shot flows will arise.

428
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,688
It's not that normal shot flows are bad.

429
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,050
But the problem is that it takes a lot of work, yet it's still not interesting.

430
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,496
It has to have a sort of bold "so-what" attitude to be entertaining.

431
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:23,984
However, 2 months later

432
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:32,480
Anno gathered the main staff at a meeting and said the following.

433
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,648
I'm thinking of rewriting the whole A-part if it isn't going well.

434
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:47,872
He said he would redo 1/4 of the script intro, that had been worked on for 9 months.

435
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:54,000
Basically I realized that my script hasn't been done properly thanks to this.

436
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:56,400
I want to rewrite it from square one.

437
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Preferably from zero, even.

438
00:36:59,024 --> 00:37:02,944
I'll start with whether A-part is even needed or not.

439
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,792
Going straight into B-part might be better.

440
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:14,880
Some of the staff gave negative comments about the Previs when he showed it.

441
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:26,864
Regardless how small that remark might have been, Anno cannot turn his eyes away from it.

442
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:40,128
We did our best and if this is the result we got, then maybe we should try better.

443
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:47,840
Anno is supported by one principle.

444
00:37:50,218 --> 00:37:54,022
My work, comes before my life.

445
00:37:59,216 --> 00:38:02,272
I think it's called placing the work above everything else.

446
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:07,488
I'm not the center, my work is.

447
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:10,368
It depends which is better for my work.

448
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,443
If I put my work and myself on a scale, my work would be heavier.

449
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:21,584
It's because I want to complete my work, even if it costs me my life.

450
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:27,232
You can't really do that after you've gotten married, but there is still an element of that.

451
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:39,152
Anno disappeared from the studio.

452
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:51,504
He shut himself inside his secret work space and started refining A-Part all over again.

453
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:58,144
The schedule has been pushed way back.

454
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:03,536
It can't be helped, let's just separate A-Part's scenes.

455
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:09,824
The script rework was exceptionally large.

456
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,568
I don't know what'll happen.

457
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,800
I don't know how I should direct that part.

458
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:27,824
However, anyone who cannot devote his whole body and soul to the project, has no place here.

459
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:37,968
It finally started to become an interesting documentary, eh?

460
00:39:39,664 --> 00:39:41,088
This is too true to be funny.

461
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:44,256
It's too true to be funny as a production.

462
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:46,480
What are you going to do?

463
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,144
Still, it's how things always are here.

464
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,272
Always? Really?

465
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,120
It's the last one. And we don't want to have any regrets.

466
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,392
Have to give it all we've got.

467
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:04,400
Anno pushes you around but you still continue to work with him.

468
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,192
Why is that?

469
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,632
I wonder why.

470
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:23,392
Only now that you've asked me that I'm wondering now.

471
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:31,280
It might be because he lets us do what we want to do the most.

472
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:37,440
If you look at other places, for better or worse, the plan is more firm.

473
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:40,672
So you're never asked to do anything more than that.

474
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,944
But that's not to say that this is the better way of working.
At least I can't say that.

475
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:59,072
If it were any other director, he'd go with this.

476
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:01,200
This is boring.

477
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,352
Boring too.

478
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,720
Boring also.

479
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,264
This is how Anno's filmmaking progresses.

480
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:22,864
He denies himself and appears to hurt himself.

481
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:31,488
Hayao Miyazaki has spoken such of Anno.

482
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:38,640
Anno makes a movie while shedding his blood.

483
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:51,152
Anno's wife Moyoko on Hideaki Anno

484
00:41:51,936 --> 00:42:01,280
I thought he'd die cause all he does is work and doesn't take care of himself.

485
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:10,016
He's abandoned life, or rather, living properly.

486
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,416
"No one to take care of you? Then I'll do it!" is what I offered.

487
00:42:15,424 --> 00:42:18,880
But food was the most difficult part.

488
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
I can't eat this (shiitake mushrooms).

489
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,176
Also, this.

490
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,984
Quite a picky guy when it comes to food, and doesn't eat meat or fish.

491
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,736
For example, at first he didn't want to eat zucchini.

492
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,152
So I carefully explained that this is like a vegetable halfway between a cucumber and a pumpkin.

493
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:42,784
And told him he can eat cucumbers and kind of likes pumpkin too.

494
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:47,808
So I assured him it's not scary.

495
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:51,312
He's really cautious towards things he doesn't know.

496
00:42:51,680 --> 00:43:01,440
It was kind of like disciplining, well not disciplining, but having an animal that doesn't really like humans to get used to them.

497
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:09,712
But if I hadn't done what I did, I think he would have died from some disease before that.

498
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,944
Really.

499
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:13,056
All he ate was sweets.

500
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,856
He eats a lot while editing.

501
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:21,840
Secretly from me, but I always find out right away.

502
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:26,064
He thinks he's the easily forgivable type.

503
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:35,264
So sometimes I tell him not to make a cute face.
Don't think I'll forgive you just because you think you're cute.

504
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:44,592
Anno's hometown: Ube, Yamaguchi.

505
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,944
His work above his own life.

506
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:58,832
How did that hard-fought way of life come into being?

507
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:22,336
Anno was born in 1960.

508
00:44:23,904 --> 00:44:26,992
And there was something he missed since childhood.

509
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,064
The memory of going on a trip with his family.

510
00:44:35,264 --> 00:44:36,832
This is an important photo.

511
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:46,464
His father Takuya lost his left leg in an accident and was not able to go out far away.

512
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:54,880
My dad hated the way the state of the world.

513
00:44:56,304 --> 00:45:03,072
The incident where he lost his leg was also not his fault.

514
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,912
There were two people were standing on both sides,

515
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,384
cutting a big tree like this.

516
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,832
And that's when the incident happened as he was holding the saw.

517
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,528
Apparently, it was the other guy that made a mistake.

518
00:45:19,328 --> 00:45:26,848
That mistake cost my father's leg and he had to visit doctors all his life.

519
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:30,592
So he bears a strong hatred towards society.

520
00:45:31,344 --> 00:45:39,232
He also bounced his grudge off of me, questioning why he was the one to experience such misfortune.

521
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:47,136
In order to fill what he was missing, Anno looked to the television.

522
00:45:54,032 --> 00:45:58,144
The first thing he became obsessed with was Tetsujin 28-go.

523
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:07,536
He didn't just watch the show, he also started drawing it.

524
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:12,000
There was one unique thing about his drawings.

525
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:19,376
When I draw a robot, he never has arms or legs.

526
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,816
I like the broken ones that have them detached.

527
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:31,840
Tetsujin 28-go often had his limbs torn, so maybe that's what I like about robots.

528
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:39,648
I now think my father is the reason why I think that some part should be missing.

529
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:46,656
There were many things missing in my everyday life. And one of them was my father.

530
00:46:52,496 --> 00:47:01,472
So that was the basis for my feeling that not having everything together is better.

531
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:04,592
Maybe that's how I want to affirm my father as being such.

532
00:47:10,688 --> 00:47:15,664
Anno continued to draw as if he were obsessed by something.

533
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:22,384
After graduating high school, he entered Osaka University of Arts.

534
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:29,920
By that time, he had become able to draw anime that outshines those done by pros.

535
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:41,600
The anime he made with his friends became a sensation.

536
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:47,952
He's bad at drawing people, but a genius at drawing explosions.

537
00:47:51,344 --> 00:47:56,320
Osamu Tezuka was also astonished at his artistic talent.

538
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,664
And when he was 23 years old, he met that man.

539
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:14,928
I thought an alien had come. An alien.

540
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,352
From the moment I first saw him I thought he was interesting. So I got him to do it.

541
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:34,720
Hayao Myazaki entrusted him with the climax scene of "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind".

542
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:39,184
The explosion of the melting Giant God Warrior.

543
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,456
This is my genga(key animation).

544
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:06,192
The thoroughly drawn genga that needed no editing impressed Miyazaki.

545
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:12,832
He started living in the studio.

546
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,800
I wonder how many hours he worked in one day.

547
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,520
In the morning when I come, his bare feet would stick out from beneath the desk.

548
00:49:22,016 --> 00:49:25,312
They were so dirty, I'd call them the feet of a cave man.

549
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:27,584
He's that kind of man.

550
00:49:29,664 --> 00:49:32,016
Nadia, look, we're flying.

551
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,504
Amazing, we're actually flying.

552
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:42,080
He debuted as a director at 28 and gave birth to a hit anime.

553
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:50,384
And at 33 he kickstarted that project.

554
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:54,832
Neon Genesis Evangelion.

555
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:02,096
He developed a desire to draw humans.

556
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,136
It meant pouring his whole existence into his work.

557
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:17,696
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with running away from unpleasantness?

558
00:50:19,408 --> 00:50:24,144
A protagonist who yearns to have his existence recognized.

559
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,096
Shinji-kun!

560
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:28,496
I'm not a child.

561
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:34,336
All the important characters were imperfect, and were missing something.

562
00:50:36,192 --> 00:50:41,072
You won't even hold me!
No one! No one! No one!

563
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:43,070
So look at me!

564
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:52,080
I think it's interesting if an originally perfect subject is in some way broken.

565
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,472
I believe that defines interestingness.

566
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:04,784
Even if I make it beautiful it won't become interesting. All it would be is beautiful.

567
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:13,920
Well, my definition of interesting is somewhat twisted.

568
00:51:17,664 --> 00:51:23,552
Lovable, because there's something missing.

569
00:51:26,112 --> 00:51:29,888
That scene went against the accepted norms.

570
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,408
It felt like it's okay for his life to end here.

571
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,515
Because he's making something that will last forever, or have an influence on somebody,

572
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:51,200
at that time he had fully thrust himself into working with the preparedness and vigor to give his life for it.

573
00:51:54,428 --> 00:52:00,200
He almost never left the director's room.

574
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,000
But he didn't eat fish or meat, so even though he didn't take a shower, he didn't smell.

575
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:14,448
Well, he did smell, but since he's vegetarian, it was more like the smell of a hen house.

576
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:23,136
Something unexpected happened after pushing himself and others to the limit.

577
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:29,096
The production couldn't meet the schedule.

578
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,944
The drawings that resembled a sketch with lines ended up being different than what had been planned.

579
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,120
It's the world around you.

580
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,832
It's not my world. I don't know!

581
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,688
There's no way I can cherish it!

582
00:52:49,824 --> 00:52:54,512
Congratulations. Congratulations.

583
00:52:56,064 --> 00:52:56,816
Thank you.

584
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,648
The ending presented many spectacles.

585
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,160
Congratulations.

586
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:12,416
Evangelion caused a social phenomenon and became a legend of an anime.

587
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:25,264
However, there was a critical outcry from some of the fans that Anno had abandoned his creation.

588
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:37,072
I believe I did my best for all the people over the world who love anime.

589
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:45,392
But there were discussion threads with the title "How to kill Hideaki Anno".

590
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:54,912
And inside them was written how to kill me in the most efficient way.

591
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,248
Kill me in this way, or that way.

592
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,256
When I saw that I stopped caring.

593
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:09,424
I kind of thought I didn't want to make anime anymore.

594
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:17,504
One time I thought of jumping in front of a train. And one time off the rooftop of my company building.

595
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,704
Around 2 times I faced this danger.

596
00:54:22,048 --> 00:54:24,272
Was there a reason that stopped you from doing it?

597
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:25,568
I thought it'd hurt.

598
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:33,168
I was fine with dying but didn't want to die in pain. I thought about it realistically and gave up.

599
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:42,736
There was one person who reached out to Anno.

600
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:51,280
Producer Suzuki Toshio, whom he had met during the production of Nausicaa.

601
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,277
His heart was somewhat in pain.

602
00:54:58,816 --> 00:55:03,232
So I thought that trying to make something would be the best medicine.

603
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:09,456
To make a step forward means to plan out a project.

604
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:19,872
After receiving help from Suzuki, he did a live-action movie set in his hometown of Ube.

606
00:55:19,966 --> 00:55:20,592
What are you doing?

607
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:23,792
Maybe it's best if I don't exist.

608
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,208
And he took up making anime again.

609
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,096
But deep inside his heart there were emotions he couldn't get rid of.

610
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:40,016
If I had done everything, it'd be a rehash of Evangelion.

611
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:45,264
It would be a self-parody of Evangelion.

612
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,730
I already put everything I thought was entertaining inside Evangelion.

613
00:55:52,999 --> 00:56:00,707
So if I tried to insert something new I believe is interesting, it'd end up being an Eva-esque work.

614
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:09,783
Anno wasn't able to escape from Evangelion.

615
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:18,544
In order to settle that feeling, he decided to remake it in the form of an anime movie.

616
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:34,464
But after producing 3 movies and taking up production of the final one, the one thing he had feared happened.

617
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:42,208
Anno broke down.

618
00:56:44,144 --> 00:56:47,408
He could no longer come to the studio.

619
00:56:49,168 --> 00:56:51,088
Depression

620
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:55,328
I broke down.

621
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:59,536
What is it that's breaking you down?

622
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:02,400
It's because I throw up everything.

623
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:07,648
I have to devote my whole body and soul to make it interesting.

624
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:11,264
I must do everything that I can.

625
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:15,344
I want to create something that's as entertaining as possible.

626
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:23,968
There was one person that stood next to Anno and supported him.

627
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,176
I believe that you can be saved as long as there's someone by your side.

628
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,336
I said

629
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:48,432
that even if everyone fades away,

630
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,376
I won't.

631
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:00,544
Regardless of how much he gets depressed or says he's had enough

632
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:06,912
even when he says he'll give up everything and goes somewhere

633
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:07,952
he'd start it over.

634
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:11,471
I believe he'll start creating again with a face as if nothing had happened.

635
00:58:14,864 --> 00:58:16,912
Because he can only live this way,

636
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:26,736
he can't go on if he doesn't complete that work.

637
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,872
He keeps saying it's "work", but I do believe it's what he really wants to do.

638
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,648
Of course, I'm like that too.

639
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,432
Still,

640
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:46,400
He loves creating something.

641
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:05,216
Anno took up the production of Evangelion once again, as 4 years went by.

642
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:09,424
Ready. Go.

643
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,832
I couldn't bring myself to give up.

644
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:21,341
I thought I couldn't make it, but I never said to myself I don't want to make it.

645
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,632
I started this, so it's my duty to finish it.

646
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,296
A duty to myself, to my staff and above everything else, to the fans.

647
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:45,728
A duty to finish it

648
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:54,448
Anno was too honest of a person.

649
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,712
A naked soul in pain.

650
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:09,008
But that's exactly why that movie moves the hearts of people.

651
01:00:11,257 --> 01:00:13,526
I believe it will properly end this time.

652
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:17,568
It will end and I will be able to end it.

653
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,976
I think it's because I was able to grow up a little.

654
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:33,248
Because my situation and my work are linked.

655
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,016
Things go in a positive direction.

656
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:41,568
That has to be the case within me too.

657
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:44,400
Or else, it will all be a lie.

658
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:49,744
The work is made true, because my inner world is part of it.

659
01:01:04,032 --> 01:01:06,176
2018, Winter.

660
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:11,168
The movie was steadily approaching completion.

661
01:01:13,088 --> 01:01:16,304
...is what couldn't be said about Evangelion.

662
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:22,272
I don't know what you're trying to do.

663
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:31,856
The D-Part of the script, which accounted for 1/4 of the final sequence, was not firmly decided on yet.

664
01:01:32,368 --> 01:01:34,704
If you explain too much...

665
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:40,496
I, personally, thought I was better understood.

666
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,536
I'm in a pinch now because I learn that I wasn't understood at all.

667
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,088
Because I'm not being understood.

668
01:01:52,368 --> 01:01:56,496
There was one year and a half left until the planned premiere of the film at this point.

669
01:02:03,504 --> 01:02:07,680
But Anno announced he would redo it from the script.

670
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:14,048
This isn't good.

671
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:16,400
It's pretty tough with the change in schedule.

672
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,536
Probably the worst situation we've been in yet.

673
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:23,616
2 months passed

674
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:32,752
However, the script was not yet done by Anno.

675
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:51,360
Up until now, we want to show only what we've come to terms with.

676
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,752
Even if that takes time.

677
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,736
But still, we have a time limit.

678
01:02:56,048 --> 01:02:57,216
I don't get any ideas.

679
01:02:57,552 --> 01:03:00,496
For whatever reason, God doesn't want to appear before me.

680
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:14,512
The dubbing of the first half began even though the script for D-part wasn't complete.

681
01:03:18,096 --> 01:03:18,784
I don't know.

682
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:21,376
What would Rei Ayanami do?

683
01:03:23,056 --> 01:03:30,096
I want to tone down the intonation on the "do" to make it less assertive.

684
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,120
Cause she's hesitant.

685
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:37,856
I don't know. What would Rei Ayanami do?

686
01:03:38,928 --> 01:03:40,048
Better, but...

687
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,712
I want more lack of confidence.

688
01:03:45,939 --> 01:03:49,509
I don't know. What would Rei Ayanami do?

689
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:52,032
Should we keep it?

690
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:52,544
Keep it.

691
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,368
It's only good for a keep.

692
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,664
Give it some more.

693
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:57,120
With less confidence?

694
01:03:58,032 --> 01:03:59,584
No, the confidence level is fine.

695
01:04:00,352 --> 01:04:01,056
What's wrong?

696
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:02,592
Something's not there.

697
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:11,024
Anno's face became sterner as the days passed.

698
01:04:22,912 --> 01:04:23,610
Please go ahead.

699
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,560
I'm okay.

700
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:32,176
The question was how true he could remain to his work.

701
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:41,056
Can he preserve himself at the cost of hurting others?

702
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:45,024
It's not entertaining as a whole.

703
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:47,728
I want you to move back here.

704
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,160
Okay.

705
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,984
And here you're going far too back.

706
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,512
Ah, yes.

707
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,344
Here you're too close.

708
01:04:54,896 --> 01:04:57,296
I get the feeling that it's all backwards.

709
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,344
I got what the previous take is doing.

710
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,016
Do you still feel up to the challenge?

711
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:08,896
Yes.

712
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,600
Yes. I will do it.

713
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,536
I got not choice but to do it.

714
01:05:17,088 --> 01:05:18,464
I also tell Anno often.

715
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:25,584
That I'll do my best. I'll do my best even if I have to sacrifice my life.

716
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,840
That's what it takes to make a work.

717
01:05:32,848 --> 01:05:34,976
It's what it means to create something.

718
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,072
I think that all a movie director needs is guts.

719
01:05:48,576 --> 01:05:52,896
Whether you have the guts to accept being blamed for everything.

720
01:05:54,688 --> 01:05:56,128
It means not to be satisfied.

721
01:05:57,632 --> 01:05:59,232
I want to continue seeking.

722
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:03,952
I don't want to end just cause it's good to a point.

723
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:09,904
Where do you draw the line?

724
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,184
The deadline.

725
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,936
Anno completed the D-Part script barely before the deadline.

726
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,424
He gathered the main staff and said:

727
01:06:36,112 --> 01:06:38,240
Since we hardly have any time

728
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:45,888
If D-Part isn't wrapped up by the end of May, we won't make it in time.

730
01:06:46,032 --> 01:06:47,120
Never gonna make it.

731
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:47,680
Right.

732
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,600
I personally believe this is the deadline.

733
01:06:53,152 --> 01:06:55,520
The main priority is to complete it.

734
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:02,064
No matter what, this film has to be completed.

735
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:14,672
The man who had given his life for the sake of a high quality work, showed a fire in his eyes to complete it.

736
01:07:17,232 --> 01:07:19,088
We saw him like that for the first time.

737
01:07:32,096 --> 01:07:34,016
Anno is carrying a heavy burden too.

738
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:38,064
Being told by the fans, things like "you didn't finish it after all,"

739
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:45,344
or "I'll wait, no matter how many years it takes," is a heavy burden for him.

740
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:57,536
I think he wants to finalize the production because he wishes to move on or remove that burden and feel lighter.

741
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,400
From where?

742
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:14,064
Page 6 of D-Part.

743
01:08:15,472 --> 01:08:18,112
The D-Part script was in handed to the voice actors.

744
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:24,400
Each of their characters' stories was drawing its end.

745
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:32,825
Unit 01 pilot, there's something I want to show you.

746
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,416
This is...

747
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,176
Doesn't a new story begin from here onward at the end?

748
01:08:44,512 --> 01:08:45,792
No, it doesn't.

749
01:08:46,608 --> 01:08:48,880
It's sad, but it's time to graduate.

750
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,280
Graduation has to happen one day.

751
01:08:53,232 --> 01:08:54,640
My Eva ends with this.

752
01:09:01,424 --> 01:09:03,744
Here, as long as you accept it, it's fine.

753
01:09:04,944 --> 01:09:06,096
Because this is the end.

754
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:09,056
If you want to cry about it, that's fine.

755
01:09:11,872 --> 01:09:12,640
Looks good.

756
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:16,784
Very good.

757
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:20,176
What should I do.

758
01:09:20,512 --> 01:09:23,056
I thought the one now was pretty good.

759
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:27,216
What should I do...

760
01:09:28,912 --> 01:09:31,376
I really don't want to cry too much.

761
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:34,992
Do it as you like.

762
01:09:36,192 --> 01:09:37,152
Make me cry.

763
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:39,488
Please make me cry.

764
01:09:41,888 --> 01:09:42,752
If it's you, it's possible.

765
01:09:45,744 --> 01:09:46,464
I'll pilot the Eva.

766
01:09:51,552 --> 01:09:54,160
Even if people hate me or talk bad about me,

767
01:09:54,352 --> 01:09:55,808
none of it matters if I'm in the Eva

768
01:09:56,928 --> 01:09:58,624
I'm only good for that, after all.

769
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:07,680
The quarter-century of pushing others and being pushed to the limit, comes to an end.

770
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:23,216
Anno added a line to the protagonist Shinji's part.

771
01:10:30,384 --> 01:10:37,808
Farewell,
to all of Evangelion

772
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,056
Wrapping up all these 25 years.

773
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,080
All those in 25 years

774
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:44,544
Oh no, that's heavy!

775
01:10:44,864 --> 01:10:48,624
If you could put all your feelings into this 25-year farewell.

776
01:10:50,256 --> 01:10:51,040
Rolling.

777
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,104
What to do...

778
01:10:55,488 --> 01:10:55,840
Alright.

779
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:11,696
Farewell, to all of Evangelion!

780
01:11:18,336 --> 01:11:20,576
We can go with this.

781
01:11:22,464 --> 01:11:25,040
I feel you gave it your all. Thank you.

782
01:11:30,096 --> 01:11:31,344
Yes, that's good.

783
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,240
Thank you.

784
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:33,584
Good job.

785
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,256
You too.

786
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:37,424
Good job.

787
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,648
At the end of 2020, the film was complete.

788
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:47,952
Thank you for your hard work. It's finished.

789
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,728
Thank you very much.

790
01:11:55,536 --> 01:11:58,928
We asked Anno something after the sleepless night.

791
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:02,384
Can I ask something?

792
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:02,944
Yes.

793
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:07,760
You mentioned you put your life on the line for your work.

794
01:12:08,528 --> 01:12:10,992
Why do you do that?

795
01:12:11,968 --> 01:12:14,896
Because I can't do anything else.

796
01:12:19,888 --> 01:12:21,408
Why do you go that far?

797
01:12:25,568 --> 01:12:27,152
How should I put this...

798
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:32,768
Because that's all I can do to be of use to society.

799
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,040
That's what my purpose in this world is limited to.

800
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,664
Thank you for all your hard work throughout these years.

801
01:12:54,944 --> 01:12:56,784
One more brief thing.

802
01:12:56,992 --> 01:12:58,848
Thank you so much.

803
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:06,430
Enjoy.

804
01:13:10,848 --> 01:13:12,768
Aren't you going to watch it?

805
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,520
No.

806
01:13:13,952 --> 01:13:14,832
Why is that?

807
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,064
I never watch it.

808
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,736
I see.

809
01:13:17,232 --> 01:13:18,864
Is there a reason?

810
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:20,048
Not really.

811
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,488
When it's completed, I need to move on to the next work.

812
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:41,440
I don't know.

813
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,728
What would Rei Ayanami do?

815
01:13:43,776 --> 01:13:44,976
I'll remove it from the 3rd ship.

816
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,456
Full speed ahead.

817
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:48,544
Understood.

818
01:13:55,728 --> 01:14:00,944
After it's completed, I just want people to be glad they made it.

819
01:14:02,512 --> 01:14:04,144
That's all I can give them in return.

820
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,810
It was fun.

821
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,352
Thank you.

822
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:13,792
I'm glad we could do it.

823
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:16,224
I was about to cry.

824
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,152
I'd been glad if you did cry.

825
01:14:19,216 --> 01:14:21,424
Wife
Moyoko Anno

826
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:30,448
What does it mean to be a professional?

827
01:14:30,864 --> 01:14:32,384
I've never thought about that.

828
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:35,696
It doesn't really matter.

829
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:37,952
if you're called a pro or not.

830
01:14:39,152 --> 01:14:42,240
I've always hated that the word is attached to this program.

831
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:45,280
I wish you'd put another title.

832
01:14:45,664 --> 01:14:46,784
Thank you.

833
01:14:48,656 --> 01:14:49,712
Thank you.
